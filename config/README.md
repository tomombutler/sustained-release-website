#Configs for Nails. enabled apps.

Apps need to be configured to use Nails. Not much configuration, granted, but a little help is needed to point them in the right direction.

If this folder is empty, you'll need to run the Nails. installer. The easiest way to configure your app is to use the [Nails Command Line Tool](http://github.com/nailsapp/command-line-tool).
